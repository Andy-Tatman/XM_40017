## Julia Basics

### NB1-Q1

In the first, line we assign a variable to a value. In the second line, we assign another variable to the same value. Thus,we have 2 variables associated with the same value. In line 3, we associate `y` to a new value (re-assignment). Thus, we have 2 variables associated with 2 different values. Variable `x` is still associated with its original value. Thus, the value at the final line is `x=1`.

### NB1-Q2

It will be `1` for very similar reasons as in the previous questions: we are reassigning a local variable, not the global variable defined outside the function.

### NB1-Q3

It will be `6`. In the returned function `f2`, `x` is equal to `2`. Thus, when calling `f2(3)` we compute `2*3`.


### Exercise 1

```julia
function ex1(a)
    j = 1
    m = a[j]
    for (i,ai) in enumerate(a)
        if m < ai
            m = ai
            j = i
        end
    end
    (m,j)
end
```

### Exercise 2

```julia
ex2(f,g) = x -> f(x) + g(x)
```

### Exercise 3

```julia
using GLMakie
max_iters = 100
n = 1000
x = LinRange(-1.7,0.7,n)
y = LinRange(-1.2,1.2,n)
heatmap(x,y,(i,j)->mandel(i,j,max_iters))
```

## Asynchronous programming in Julia


### NB2-Q1

Evaluating `compute_Ï€(100_000_000)` takes about 0.25 seconds. Thus, the loop would take about 2.5 seconds since we are calling the function 10 times.

### NB2-Q2

The time in doing the loop will be almost zero since the loop just schedules 10 tasks, which should be very fast.

### NB2-Q3

It will take 2.5 seconds, like in question 1. The `@sync` macro forces to wait for all tasks we have generated with the `@async` macro. Since we have created 10 tasks and each of them takes about 0.25 seconds, the total time will be about 2.5 seconds.

### NB2-Q4

It will take about 3 seconds. The channel has buffer size 4, thus the call to `put!`will not block. The call to `take!` will not block neither since there is a value stored in the channel. The taken value is 3 and therefore we will wait for 3 seconds. 

### NB2-Q5

The channel is not buffered and therefore the call to `put!` will block. The cell will run forever, since there is no other task that calls `take!` on this channel.
